			<h1>Who We Are</h1>
			<h2>Our Belief</h2>
		<p class="paragraph1">
			We believe strongly in education. Where we differ from most others with similar beliefs is that we do not believe education can only be gotten within the 4 walls of a classroom. To us, education is synonymous to useful information. Whether you agree or not, music, movies, stories, seminars/webinars, workshops, games etc are also all forms of education. In fact, studies have shown that education gotten via these other mediums are more efficient. Movies and music can be direct or indirect. Direct forms could include documentary type movies, indirect movies are the most subtle but yet, most powerful. The indirect movies work at a subconscious level. Here are two examples. Most movies we've been exposed to in our lifetime usually depicts rich people as evil. They're usually the bad guys. We have subconsciously linked money to evil, and other sayings that appear harmless further reinforces this belief. Example will be "He is stinkingly rich" or "Money is the root of all evil". Another example of movies working indirectly to educate us on a subconscious level is the archetype hollywood or disney hunk that all the girls want. Ask most girls what physical attributes do they want in a man, and 90% of the time will say, tall, dark and handsome. I bet you've never met a lady saying she wants a man who is short, pot bellied, bald and pale. These are all disney 'Prince' type characters and because most ladies have been convinced that they're princesses, they believe they deserve nothing less than a prince.

			<h2>Blueprints</h2>
		<p class="paragraph2">
			We are here to interrupt the financial subconscious mind state which we refer to as blueprints. Let's do a little exercise, complete the statements below
			<br>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Money doesn't grow on ------</li>
				<li>A penny saved is a penny ------</li>
				<li>A honest days job for a honest days --------</li>
				<li>Rich people are ---------</li>
				<li>I can't afford --------</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<p class="paragraph2">
			The list is endless. Many of these myths have been dispelled but unless these poor phrases are replaced with rich phrases like "I can't afford it" be changed to "How can I afford it", or "I can't afford it yet, but soon I'll be able to". Your financial blueprint needs to change if you want your financial status to change. Many also believe that most rich people inherited their money, this couldn't be further from the truth. In a study of interview of over 10,000 millionaires, it was established that the vast majority of rich people did not inherit their wealth.

			<h2>Recommendations</h2>
		<p class="paragraph3">
			As you'll come to realize, money does grow on figurative trees. All you need to know is to identify what kind of tree and how to plant, water and look after it. Also, you'll come to realize that you cannot save your way to wealth. If by any sort of miracle you do, you'll always feel financially insecure which makes you not different from the middle class or poor because it's all in the head. Your purchasing power when you save also diminishes because interest rate is about 1% while inflation is over 2%. So you lose value on an annual basis. You'll also find out that exchanging your time for money will never get you financial freedom or wealth. As Warren Buffet once said, "If you do not find a way to make money while you sleep, you'll most likely work till you die". To change your blueprint, we'll recommend a book that all of us at Project 2 agree to be the best.
