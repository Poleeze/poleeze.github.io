			The only way to truly see who is poor, middle class and rich is by viewing their financial statements. Do not be fooled by material possessions, most of it are either liabilities or doodads
			as explained in the other pages. If you don't like maths or you find it boring, simple arithmetics is all you need to draw a simple diagram of the financial statements. With this, you can
			tell where a person belongs. I'll show you 3 diagrams of a financial statement cashflow of the rich, middle class and poor and the last diagram will show you what part of the market quadrant
			most of them operate from.<br>
			<a class="em">The top left</a> is the financial statement cashflow of the poor. Money comes in and most of it goes out via expenses. <br><a class="em">The top right</a> is the financial statement cashflow of the middle class. Money comes in, and it goes out via expenses and liabilities. The middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets.<br> <a class="em">The bottom left</a> is the financial statement cashflow of
			the rich. Money comes in via the asset column, not from a job. What you want to do is buy assets with a good portion of the money from your job so that the assets continue to pay you. <br> And <a class="em">the last image on bottom right</a> is the cashflow quadrant which displays the only 4 quadrants you can make your money from.
			The last image (bottom left) which is the cashflow quadrant has the alphabets E, S, B and I. We'll be focusing on this as we have discussed the other 3 extensively in the Home page. 
			The 'E' stands from Employee. These are people who make the most of their income from their jobs.
			This would represent the vast majority of the populace. The 'S' stands for the Self Employed. The self employed are usually (not always) Employees who want to become entrepreneurs but get 
			stuck as a job owner. Most of them think they own a business but in reality, they own their jobs. There are no holiday or sick pays and very little number of employees. They have their own
			self directed pension fund. The 'B' are the business owners. The business owners pay the least tax amongst all three discussed so far, sometimes even 0%. The difference between a 'B' and an 'S' 
			is usually how the business is setup, which can reflect in the amount of tax and free time both can have. The business owner owns a system and can be away from the system for extended 
			periods of time without suffering losses, whereas the self employed can't. Self employed are usually setup as sole proprietorship while Business owners have LLCs, S corps, C corps etc. 
			The last group is the 'I' which stands for Investors. These people use money to make money. Depending on how sophisticated they are, they can range from using their own money to make money, 
			or using other people's money in the form of leverage to make money. If structured well, they can pay 0% in tax as well.
