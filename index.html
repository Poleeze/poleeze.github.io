			<h2>Taboo</h2>
			The topic of money is something rarely talked about at dinner tables, either at home or at formal events. A few topics are almost a taboo to discuss in public. They are money, religion and politics. These topics seem to be very sensitive topics that can get people flying off the handle pretty quickly. I can understand if some people distance themselves from politics and religion,
			but amuses me is people trying not to talk about money. What is even bigger of an amusement is that everybody has an opinion. The rich, the poor, the middle class. And they all believe their opinions are valid. Don't get me wrong, there's something you can learn from all three classes of people regarding money, the important thing is to learn the right stuff. A book that can change your reality and recommended by us to read is <a href="https://store.richdad.com/products/rich-dad-poor-dad-what-the-rich-teach-their-kids-about-money-that-the-poor-and-middle-class-do-not" target="_blank">RICH DAD POOR DAD</a>
			<h2>Personal Finance</h2>
			On this platform, we'll only be discussing money or finance. When was the last time you did a personal or family finance account? Do you set annual or quarterly or monthly financial goals? Do you check to see if you're on track? The company you work for does it, or if you have a self employed business, it warrants this. So why do people not do it on a personal level? Most people believe that being rich or financially free has to do with being in the right place at the right time. This doesn't hold true and it's further discussed in our ABOUT page.

			<h2>Questions To Ponder</h2>
			If I were to ask people who think wealth has to do with luck or inheritance a few questions, I bet their answers to all 3 questions will be No. The questions are: How many personal finance seminars/webinars have they attended in the last 90days? How many income generating assets do they have? Do they have personal finance coaches? I can guarantee you the answers will be NO in all cases. Yet, all millionaires have coaches, all athletes have coaches. If you're going to be a huge success in any personal endeavor, you need a coach. The simple knowledge of knowing the difference between assets and liabilities can make a world of a difference. If you ask scholars and accountants what the definition of an asset and liability is, you'll hear quite a few sophisticated words that you might need a class module to understand. But the rich have a simple definition for it.
